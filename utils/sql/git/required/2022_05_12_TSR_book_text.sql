Arlyxir has always been`a trusted go-between for`Solusek and his father Fennin.`However, Arlyxir has decided`to form alliance with Solusek.`The decision of direct`confrontation against the`populace of Norrath was not an`easy one to make. They both`know that Fennin would not`agree to such a hostile act,`because the Pantheon would`not condone it.`After many hours of`incantations a great well`marked with runes of flame`appeared and began to pour the`very essence of the Plane of`Fire into the Tower. The`Guardians of Dresolik, the`Great Shard, watch over the`pulsating crystal as it`harnesses the power being`siphoned from the Plane of`Fire. Only time stands`between us now. Those that I`once walked with will soon`learn of the mistakes in their`transgressions.`I can hear Xuzl in his tower,`always working on his`conjurings. The crackle of`the animated regiment of`flaming swords can be`deafening. Xuzl does not take`any time to rest; for he knows`as we all do that the time`draws near. Greater Fiends`have been constructed by`Solusek to spread their curse`upon any that survive the`initial destructive force from`Dresolik. The seven fiends`will be generals of the army`being conjured by Xuzl.`Solusek has also placed his`trust in two elementals.`These elementals have`coalesced into the form of`wyverns. I must say that I am`quite partial to their new form,`and have formed a kinship with`them. Together with them we`will exterminate any`dragonkind that are resistant`enough to flame to save them`from the onslaught that`Dresolik will provide.`Dresolik pulses with extreme`power, it will soon be`powerful enough to scorch`Norrath. I can only hope that`my voice and praise of Solusek`will be enough to give the`others the strength needed to`continue.' WHERE NAME = 'TSRRiz';
